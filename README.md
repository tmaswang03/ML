# Machine Learning
Documented machine learning journey that I have embarked on. Currently, you will find logistic regression and SVM models in my repository trained via kaggle data sets. Feel free to explore and let me know if you spot any problems. 

# Available Models
Some models featured include Random Forests, Support Vector Machines and basic logistic regression. All models have been trained on kaggle data sets. Hyperparameter tuning is completed using HyperOpt for Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. 

# Data Preprocessing
So far, I haven't learnt alot of data preprocessing. As of now, data is prepared using onehotencoding done via dummys in Panda's library. Afterwards, I use a simpleimputer from Scikit-learn. Typically, I will stick to the mean strategy but it varies based on data sets.
